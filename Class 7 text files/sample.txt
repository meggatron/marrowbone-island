The giant shrimp lives in the laundry room beneath the boathouse.
He rarely speaks, and when he does, it's short and direct.
He says he's from Bremerton, though no one has confirmed this.
Old detergent bottles line his chamber like sentries.
At night, you can hear him reorganizing the shelves.
He keeps a small radio tuned to maritime traffic.
The washer is broken. The dryer hums when he's thinking.
Visitors leave offerings: socks, pennies, old poetry zines.
Once, he gave someone advice so sharp they left the island.
His antennae twitch when someone nearby is lying.
